# OVER-GENERALIZATION ISSUE

Test results show system generalizes TOO MUCH:

Training: cat→sat, bat→sat, mat→sat

Expected behavior:
  'rat' (0.67 similar) → 'sat' ✓ Good!
  'beans' (0.0 similar) → (nothing) ✓ Should be honest!

Actual behavior:
  'rat' → 'sat' ✓
  'beans' → 'sat' ✗ Over-generalizing!

Similarity scores:
  beans vs cat: 0.00 (no matches)
  beans vs bat: 0.20 (only 'b')  
  beans vs mat: 0.00
  
Threshold: 0.50

beans < 0.50 for all → should NOT generalize!

HYPOTHESIS:
Maybe it's:
1. Finding ANY similarity (even < 0.5)
2. Defaulting to most common rule
3. Bug in similarity check
4. Creating rule from wrong node

Need to trace:
- Is generalize_rules() being called for 'beans'?
- Which node is it finding as "similar"?
- What's the actual similarity score calculated?

This reveals important question:
Should system have a FALLBACK when no rules match?
Or should it output nothing (honest about ignorance)?
