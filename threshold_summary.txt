THRESHOLDS THAT LIMIT THE GRAPH:

✅ REMOVED:
1. similarity_threshold (0.5) → Now uses BEST match

🔒 REMAINING:

2. OUTPUT filter (line 365):
   if (g.nodes[i].state < 0.5f) continue;
   → Skips nodes with weak activation
   → Rule execution sets state=0.8, so this passes
   → Could remove to output ALL activated nodes

3. INPUT detection (lines 231, 313, 354):
   if (g.nodes[i].state < 0.99f) continue;
   → Only processes FULLY active nodes (state=1.0)
   → This is needed to distinguish input from generated

4. PATTERN creation (line 399):
   if (rule->times_executed < 5) continue;
   → Only creates patterns from well-used rules
   → Prevents noise

5. LEARNING adaptation (line 438):
   if (reuse_ratio < 0.5f)
   → Adjusts learning based on generalization ratio
   → Meta-parameter

RECOMMENDATION:
- Keep state checks (needed for input/output distinction)
- Remove output threshold (0.5) to show ALL results
- Keep pattern threshold (prevents noise)
