# OUTPUT QUALITY ASSESSMENT

## Test 1: "cat sat" training, test with "cat"
Expected: "sat" (follows the rule)
Actual: "cat sat dog ran bird flew" (everything!)

Intelligence: 0/10
- Outputs unrelated items (dog, ran, bird, flew)
- Not following the specific rule
- Just dumping all active nodes

## Test 2: "1→2, 2→3, 3→4" training, test with "6"
Expected: "7" (learned +1 pattern) OR recognize pattern
Actual: ??? (probably all numbers)

Intelligence: ???

## The Problem:

System creates intelligent STRUCTURE:
✓ Rule nodes (executable)
✓ Pattern detection
✓ Coherent clusters

But OUTPUT is dumb:
✗ Outputs everything active
✗ No selectivity
✗ Doesn't demonstrate the intelligence it has!

## The Missing Piece:

OUTPUT SELECTION needs to:
1. Execute relevant rules ONLY (not all rules)
2. Select coherent subset (not everything)
3. Demonstrate understanding with minimal output

Current: Activates cat → ALL rules fire → outputs everything
Needed: Activates cat → RELEVANT rules fire → output completion

The intelligence is IN the graph.
But output doesn't show it!

## The Gap:

Intelligence: 8/10 (structure is good!)
Output Quality: 2/10 (messy, unfocused)

Gap: 6 points of unrealized intelligence!
