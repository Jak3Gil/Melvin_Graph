# THE OUTPUT FILTER RULE

Current problem:
  Activation spreads everywhere (associations)
  But we output everything activated (messy!)

## User's insight:
"Just because something activates doesn't mean it's in final output"

## The Question:
What's the RULE for: activated → output?

## Options:

### 1. THRESHOLD (simple)
```
if (activation > 0.8) → output
else → suppress
```
Pro: Simple
Con: Arbitrary threshold

### 2. TOP-N (ranking)
```
Output only top 5 most activated
```
Pro: Clean output
Con: Loses information

### 3. STRUCTURAL COHERENCE
```
if (node_fits_current_pattern) → output
else → suppress even if activated
```

Example:
  Input: "the quick"
  Pattern: [the, adjective, noun]
  
  Activated: quick(1.0), brown(0.8), fox(0.6), slow(0.3), dog(0.2)
  
  Check positions:
    - "quick" at pos 1 (adjective) ✓ fits pattern
    - "brown" at pos 2 (adjective) ✓ fits pattern  
    - "fox" at pos 3 (noun) ✓ fits pattern
    - "slow" at pos 1 (adjective) ✓ fits BUT conflicts with "quick"!
    - "dog" at pos 3 (noun) ✓ fits BUT conflicts with "fox"!
    
  Output: quick, brown, fox (coherent pattern)
  Suppress: slow, dog (activated but don't fit!)

### 4. COMPETITION
```
Nodes at SAME POSITION compete
Winner: highest activation
Losers: suppressed
```

This is like winner-takes-all at each position!

### 5. ENERGY COST
```
Activation is free (spreads everywhere)
Output costs energy
Only output if:
  activation_strength > energy_cost
```

Weak activations don't have enough energy to output!

## Which Rule?

I think #3 (structural coherence) or #4 (competition) matches your intuition:

"slow" and "dog" activate (via edges)
But they DON'T fit the "quick" pattern
So they're suppressed in output!

What do you think?
