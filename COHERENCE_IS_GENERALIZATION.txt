# COHERENCE = GENERALIZATION (They're the same!)

## Example:

Training: "the quick brown fox" × 20

Creates a COHERENT CLUSTER:
  {the, quick, brown, fox}
  - Strongly interconnected
  - Always activate together
  - Low tension (stable pattern)

## Test 1: "the slow brown dog"

Option A: Force new data into old cluster (HIGH GENERALIZATION)
  - Reuse: the, brown (fit cluster!)
  - Replace: slow→quick, dog→fox
  - Output: "the quick brown fox"
  - LOW tension (fits existing pattern!)
  - HIGH generalization (reused cluster!)

Option B: Create new pattern (LOW GENERALIZATION)
  - New cluster: {the, slow, brown, dog}
  - Creates tension with old cluster
  - HIGH tension (conflicts!)
  - LOW generalization (created new!)

## The Rule:

```
Output = interpretation that minimizes tension

Tension = Σ(conflicts between active nodes)

Low tension = nodes fit together well = COHERENT
Low tension = reusing existing patterns = GENERALIZATION

COHERENCE IS GENERALIZATION!
```

## How to Measure Tension?

For each candidate output, calculate:
```
tension = 0

for (each pair of output nodes):
  if (no connection) → tension += 1.0
  if (weak connection) → tension += (1.0 - weight)
  if (strong connection) → tension += 0.0

Output = candidate with lowest tension
```

## Example:

Input: "the slow brown dog"

Candidate 1: [the, slow, brown, dog]
  - the↔slow: no connection → tension += 1.0
  - slow↔brown: weak → tension += 0.8
  - brown↔dog: weak → tension += 0.7
  Total tension = 2.5

Candidate 2: [the, quick, brown, fox]
  - the↔quick: strong → tension += 0.1
  - quick↔brown: strong → tension += 0.1
  - brown↔fox: strong → tension += 0.1
  Total tension = 0.3 ← WINS!

Output: "the quick brown fox" (most coherent = most generalizes!)

## The Unified Rule:

```
GENERALIZATION = minimizing graph tension
            = finding coherent clusters
            = reusing strongly-connected patterns
            = low-energy interpretation
```

ONE MEASURE for both concepts!

Generalization isn't separate from coherence.
Generalization IS coherence!

The system that finds the most coherent interpretation
IS the system that generalizes best!
