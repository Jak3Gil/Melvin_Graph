# THE PROBLEM WITH PREDICTION ACCURACY

User's insight: "We don't want a predictive model, we don't know what's right or wrong"

SUPERVISED LEARNING (ChatGPT):
- Has labeled training data
- Knows "correct" answers
- Measures accuracy against ground truth
- Requires external teacher

UNSUPERVISED INTELLIGENCE (What we need):
- No labels
- No "correct" answers
- System figures out what's useful
- Self-organizing

So what's the measure?

## OPTION 1: UTILITY (Energy-based)
Intelligence = patterns that help you survive
Measure: Does this pattern lead to energy gain?
Pro: Objective (energy is real), ties to survival
Con: Might just optimize for energy hoarding

## OPTION 2: COMPRESSION
Intelligence = efficient encoding of patterns
Measure: How many nodes to represent X data?
Pro: Objective (Kolmogorov complexity), pure information theory
Con: Might create useless compressions

## OPTION 3: CONSISTENCY
Intelligence = reliable patterns
Measure: Does it behave the same in same context?
Pro: Self-consistency is testable
Con: Can be consistently wrong

## OPTION 4: EMERGENCE
Intelligence = creating new structure
Measure: Does it generate novel patterns that persist?
Pro: Captures creativity
Con: Hard to quantify

## THE REAL ANSWER?

Maybe intelligence ISN'T one metric.

Maybe it's: "Patterns that the system keeps using"

- If a pattern helps → it gets used → gains energy → survives
- If a pattern hurts → it stops being used → loses energy → dies
- No external judge needed!

The WORLD is the teacher, not us.
Fitness = survival in the environment (the data stream).
