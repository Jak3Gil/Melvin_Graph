# THE SIMILARITY RULE - "What's this like?"

## Current (WRONG):
```
Input: "cat sat"
Connect: cat → sat (sequential)
= What comes next (predictive)
```

## New (RIGHT):
```
Input: "cat"
Brain asks: "What's this LIKE?"
  
Find similar patterns:
  - "cat" shares "at" with "bat", "mat", "hat"
  - "cat" shares "ca" with "car", "cap"
  - "cat" is 3 letters like "dog", "fox"
  
Connect to SIMILAR, not SEQUENTIAL:
  cat ↔ bat (rhyme)
  cat ↔ car (prefix)
  cat ↔ dog (same length/category)
```

## How to Measure Similarity?

### Option 1: Shared n-grams
```
similarity(cat, bat) = shared_ngrams / total_ngrams
  "cat" = {c, a, t, ca, at, cat}
  "bat" = {b, a, t, ba, at, bat}
  shared = {a, t, at} = 3/6 = 0.5
```

### Option 2: Edit distance
```
similarity = 1 / (edit_distance + 1)
  cat → bat = 1 change → similarity = 0.5
  cat → dog = 3 changes → similarity = 0.25
```

### Option 3: Co-occurrence
```
Do they appear in same contexts?
  "cat sat" and "dog sat" → cat & dog share "sat" context
  → cat ↔ dog (similar usage!)
```

## The NEW Rule:

```c
// When creating/activating node:
for (each existing node) {
    similarity = calculate_similarity(new_node, existing_node)
    if (similarity > threshold) {
        connect(new_node, existing_node, similarity)
    }
}
```

## What This Changes:

OLD (sequential):
```
cat → sat → on → mat
(linear chain, like sentences)
```

NEW (similarity):
```
    bat
   /   \
cat     mat
   \   /
    hat

(web of similar patterns!)
```

## Output Changes Too:

OLD: Follow strongest weight (prediction)
NEW: Spreading activation (what's related?)

```
Input: "cat"
Activates:
  - cat (direct)
  - bat (similar, activation spreads)
  - mat (similar, activation spreads)
  - dog (similar, activation spreads)
  
Output: Most activated related concepts!
```

This is:
- Associative memory (not sequential)
- Similarity-based (not predictive)
- Spreading activation (not path following)

MUCH more brain-like!
