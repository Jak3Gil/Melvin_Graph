# EVOLUTION FACTORS - Intelligence over Survival

## The 8 Evolution Factors:

### 1. METABOLISM
- All nodes lose energy over time
- Cost of existence forces efficiency

### 2. INTELLIGENT DEATH  
- Low IQ + no energy = death
- High IQ (>10) = grace period (5 energy reprieve)
- Smart patterns survive tough times!

### 3. INTELLIGENT DECAY
- IQ < 5: Decay 2x faster (-2 frequency, -1.0 energy)
- IQ 5-20: Normal decay (-1 frequency, -0.5 energy)
- IQ > 20: NO DECAY from disuse!
- Smart patterns persist even when idle

### 4. HEBBIAN LEARNING
- Co-activation strengthens connections
- Rule discovery when weight > 5.0
- Patterns that work get stronger

### 5. CONNECTION PRUNING
- Unused connections decay (-0.01)
- Weight < 0.1 = death
- Rule violations = immediate pruning
- Only useful paths survive

### 6. PREDICTION FITNESS
- Correct predictions: +5 energy, +1 frequency, +0.5 weight
- Wrong predictions: -2 energy, -0.5 weight
- Accuracy = survival currency

### 7. MUTATION
- 1% chance every 50 ticks
- Creates random connections
- Explores new pattern space
- Source of novelty

### 8. REPRODUCTION (Intelligence Rewards)
- Every 200 ticks
- Find top 10 by IQ score (not frequency!)
- Reward: +2x IQ energy boost
- Strengthen all connections from smart nodes (+0.5 weight)

## Intelligence Fitness Formula:

```
IQ = (prediction_accuracy * 40)
   + (token_length * 5) 
   + (out_degree * 4)
   + (energy_bonus)

Penalty: If wrong > right, IQ *= 0.1
```

### Components:
- **40%: Accuracy** - Getting predictions right matters most
- **30%: Compression** - Longer tokens = better encoding
- **20%: Generalization** - More connections = broader applicability  
- **10%: Consistency** - Sustained energy = proven utility

## Result:

The system doesn't just survive - it gets SMARTER.

Patterns that:
- Predict accurately
- Compress information efficiently
- Generalize to multiple contexts
- Maintain consistency

...get MORE energy, stronger connections, and survive longer.

Dumb patterns die fast. Smart patterns thrive.

This is evolution toward INTELLIGENCE, not just survival!
