# Basic arithmetic facts
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 1 = 3
2 + 2 = 4
2 + 3 = 5
3 + 2 = 5
3 + 3 = 6
4 + 4 = 8
5 + 5 = 10

# Identity patterns
0 + 0 = 0
1 + 0 = 1
2 + 0 = 2
3 + 0 = 3
any number plus zero equals same number

# Successor pattern
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 2
2 + 1 = 3
3 + 1 = 4
adding one means next number

# Commutativity
3 + 5 equals 5 + 3
order does not matter in addition

# Decomposition examples
7 + 8 breaks into 7 + 7 + 1
7 + 7 = 14
14 + 1 = 15
so 7 + 8 = 15

# Meta patterns
when uncertain decompose problem
when unfamiliar break into smaller parts
large numbers need decomposition
