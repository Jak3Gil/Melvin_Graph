# WHAT TO REMOVE vs MAKE DYNAMIC

## REMOVE (Unnecessary complexity):
✗ Meta-nodes (21 nodes for parameters) - just use variables
✗ Hub detection (detect_hubs) - over-engineering
✗ Pattern detection (detect_patterns) - over-engineering  
✗ Pattern members array[16] - not using
✗ Test cases system - not needed for core
✗ Prediction tracking - removed (no prediction!)
✗ Validation functions - too complex
✗ Magic number thresholds - should emerge

## MAKE DYNAMIC (Grow as needed):
✓ node_cap (currently 10,000) → grow on demand
✓ connection_cap (currently 100,000) → grow on demand
✓ token[16] → token[64] or unlimited
✓ ngram_len (currently ≤10) → adaptive
✓ propagation hops (currently 5) → until stable
✓ recent_active (currently 10) → dynamic window

## KEEP MINIMAL:
✓ Nodes (token + state)
✓ Connections (src, dst, weight)
✓ Energy system
✓ Input → create/reuse nodes
✓ Sequential wiring
✓ Hebbian learning (co-activation strengthens)
✓ Output by following rules

RESULT: Much simpler, more dynamic system!
