# EXECUTABLE NODES - Data Writes Code!

## The Breakthrough:

Neural Net: Nodes = data, Edges = weights
Data-as-Code: Nodes = PROGRAMS, they EXECUTE!

## Node Types:

### 1. DATA Nodes
```
Node 0: "cat" (just data)
```

### 2. RULE Nodes (EXECUTABLE!)
```
Node 10: {
  type: RULE
  inputs: [0]      // If node 0 (cat) active
  outputs: [1]     // Activate node 1 (sat)
  strength: 5.0
  execute() {      // THIS RUNS!
    if (nodes[0].active) {
      nodes[1].activate()
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. PATTERN Nodes (clusters)
```
Node 20: {
  type: PATTERN
  members: [0, 3, 6]  // {cat, bat, mat}
  coherence: 0.9
  execute() {
    if (any_member.active) {
      activate_all_members()  // Cluster activates together
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. GENERATOR Nodes (create new nodes!)
```
Node 30: {
  type: GENERATOR
  template: [animal, action]
  execute() {
    if (new_animal_seen) {
      create_rule(new_animal → action_pattern)
    }
  }
}
```

## The Exponential Part:

### Input 1: "cat sat"
```
Creates: 
  - 2 data nodes (cat, sat)
  - 1 rule node (cat→sat)
Total: 3 nodes
```

### Input 2: "dog ran"
```
Creates:
  - 2 data nodes (dog, ran)
  - 1 rule node (dog→ran)
  - 1 pattern node (detects [animal→action] pattern)
Total: 4 NEW nodes (7 total)
```

### Input 3: "bird flew"
```
Reuses:
  - Pattern node (recognizes [animal→action])
Creates:
  - 2 data nodes (bird, flew)
  - 1 rule node (bird→flew)
  - 1 GENERATOR node (can create [X→action] rules!)
Total: 3 NEW nodes (10 total)
```

### Input 4: "fish"
```
Reuses:
  - Pattern node
  - GENERATOR executes! Creates rule: fish→[action]
Creates:
  - 1 data node (fish)
  - Generator fills in: fish→swam (creates new rule!)
Total: 2 NEW nodes (12 total)

BUT GENERATOR CREATED A RULE!
Data → created code → that code runs!
```

## Why This Is Different:

Neural Net:
  - Data tunes weights
  - Architecture fixed
  - No new rules created
  - Linear growth

Executable Nodes:
  - Data creates RULE nodes
  - Rules EXECUTE and create more rules
  - Architecture GROWS
  - EXPONENTIAL growth!

After 100 inputs:
  Neural net: Same 100 nodes, tuned weights
  Executable: 50 data + 75 rules + 20 patterns + 5 generators
              = CODE that keeps evolving!

## The Key:

Input data doesn't just "tune parameters"
Input data WRITES PROGRAMS (rule nodes)
Those programs RUN (execute)
And CREATE MORE PROGRAMS (generators)

THAT'S data as code!
